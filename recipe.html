    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter and our two 8-by-2-inch cake pans,<br>
tapping out excess our. In a medium bowl, whisk our, baking powder,<br>
baking soda, salt, and lemon zest.<br><br>
In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat butter and 1 &frac12; cups sugar<br>
until light and uffy. With mixer on low, beat in eggs and yolks, one at a<br>
time. Beat in 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Alternately beat in our mixture<br>
and buttermilk beginning and ending with our mixture; mix just until<br>
combined.<br><br>
Divide batter between pans; smooth tops. Bake until cakes pull away from<br>
sides of pans, 32 to 35 minutes. Let cool in pans 10 minutes. Run a knife<br>
around edges of pans and invert cakes onto a wire rack.<br><br>
While cakes are baking, bring remaining &frac12; cup sugar and &frac12; cup water to<br>
a boil in a saucepan. Add lemon slices and simmer 25 minutes. Using a<br>
slotted spoon, transfer lemon slices to a waxed-paper-lined plate. Stir<br>
remaining &frac14; cup fresh lemon juice into syrup.<br><br>
Using a toothpick, poke holes in warm cakes on rack. Brush with lemon<br>
syrup. Let cool completely. Prepare frosting, substituting 2 tablespoons<br>
fresh lemon juice for vanilla extract. Frost cooled cakes and top with<br>
candied lemon slices.
